# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

Written in Python 3.14, no libraries, no LLM suggestions.

Only objective was to solve the problems and get the correct answer.
These solutions mostly lack optimizations, compact code and fast algorithms.

Most of them still solve the problem well under a second, and one of them under a minute.

Problems solved: \
✅ 1.1 ✅ 1.2 \
✅ 2.1 ✅ 2.2 \
✅ 3.1 ✅ 3.2 \
